Mainly adds 3 new curse enchantments:

- Curse of Karma (Hurts owner by chance)
- Curse of Kindness (Heals victim instead of hurting)
- Curse of Randomness (Shuffles enchantments except curses of the item)

<br>
Adds new "lightning rod" aka Maledictus Aufero:

- If a lightning hits this "lightning rod", it will delete curses from items. But be aware: If you have more than one item lying around, chances are high that the curse just moves to another item

<br>
Negative energy:

- Will be collected for each item
- Hidden value
- Increases while in the nether and item in (off-)hand
- Increases when hurting undead mobs
- Will be halved when near Maledictus Aufero during lightning strike
