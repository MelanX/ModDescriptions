### **Ex Naturae** combines [Botania]({mod_hoster}botania) and [Ex Nihilo: Sequentia](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ex-nihilo-sequentia)

*(both required, Ex Nihilo unfortunally not on Modrinth yet)*

It adds a bunch of new hammers and crooks made with Botania resources. They all consume mana to repair.<br>
The Elementium Hammer spawns pixies to protect you from nearby monsters. The range and spawn chance is configurable.<br>
The Terrasteel Hammer has a higher range while breaking and benefits from Ring of Thor. <br>
The Dreamwood Crook will also have a chance to still drop saplings when breaking leaves.<br>
This mod is compatible with Ex Compressum and adds compressed variants of the hammers and crooks when loaded.<br>
