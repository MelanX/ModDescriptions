This mod doesn't need to be installed on server, it works if only installed on client.

Swaps automatically to the correct tool when mining if it's in hotbar. It works with modded tools, too.

If you want to disable the swap you need to sneak while breaking the block.

There's also a key (default G) which disables/enables the switching.
