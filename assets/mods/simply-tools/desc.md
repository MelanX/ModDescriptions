This mod is the successor of [Vanilla Hammers]({mod_hoster}vanilla-hammers) and
[Vanilla Excavators]({mod_hoster}vanilla-excavators) for Forge on 1.19+. It could be combined with
[MoreVanillaLib]({mod_hoster}morevanillalib) to have some special effects for most of the tools.

{overview.png}

Hammers will mine like a pickaxe, but in a 3x3 area.

Excavators will mine like a shovel, but in a 3x3 area.

If [MoreVanillaTools]({mod_hoster}morevanillatools) is present, the tool materials of this mod will also enable hammers 
and excavators for it.
