{overview.png}

You have too much redstone or nether quartz? You don't know what you're wasting it on? This mod isÂ the solution!

It adds the following stuff for the following materials.

You want more functionality? Try installing [MoreVanillaLib]({mod_hoster}morevanillalib). It adds a few features, an
extra config, and [JEI]({mod_hoster}jei) integration.

Each tool has its right to exist. Mainly the pickaxes have an effect when mining the respective ore. Each tool has a 
higher chance of dropping more of the respective material (turn on in MoreVanillaLib config). Only obsidian increases 
the mining speed.

Be aware of using paper tools: They could cut you to death.
