<br>
This is a mod which applies random Curse enchantments at three random times from midnight to 3am in-game. These times 
are resettet each day. The chance is configurable in the server config. To prevent this, you simply need to sleep.
But be aware, too many sleeping may add curses, too. This is configurable as well. The mod needs to be on client **and**
server. If the mod is only on server, the client will only see the unlocalized message.
