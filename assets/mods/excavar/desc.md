A lightweight excavation mod for modern Minecraft versions.

{overview.png}

With this mod, you can press a key and mine blocks to harvest a lot more than just one at once.

The config is very simple. Max blocks to destroy at once (default 16), and if the correct tool for drops is required 
(default true). If this is false, you could simply dig through cobblestone or netherrack without needing the tool. 
Obviously, there still wouldn't be any drops.

Drops will be dropped at the place of the block. It's not being teleported to you or your inventory.

This mod isn't meant to replace [FTB Ultimine](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-ultimine-forge) but
adding an alternative mod which is more lightweight, without different shapes and stuff like this.
