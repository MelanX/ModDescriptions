### **1.19+ was merged with [Vanilla Hammers]({mod_hoster}vanilla-hammers) and is available as [Simply Tools]({mod_hoster}simply-tools).**<br><br>

Vanilla Hammers adds a few excavators to Minecraft 1.14+ which can mine a 3x3 area. The excavator is like a shovel, so you can mine dirt and sandy materials.

This mod was originally made by [Draylar for Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-excavators) and I ported the mod and took all it's textures to Forge. I hope you enjoy the mod as much as I while making it.
