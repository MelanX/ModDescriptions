A Minecraft mod which adds various things. Some useful things, other not so useful things.

There is no main category the mod fits in. It adds e.g. redstone things, combat things, and nice to have things.

A list with the features is available in the [Readme](https://github.com/MelanX/UtilitiX#utilitix) on GitHub.

This mod is **not completely done yet**. There are some things which will be added in the future. Once version 1.0.0 is 
released, all planned features are included.

If there is any recipe missing, it is intended because the item is unfinished or can be obtained in any other way.
