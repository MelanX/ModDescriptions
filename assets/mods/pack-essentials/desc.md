# Pack Essentials

This mod is mainly for my own modpacks. If I need something which can't be added by another mod, it'll be added here. Some easier stuff is also included, such as basic items.

### Config

This mod can be configured for each modpack to only include the required items/blocks/features.

### "Normal" user

If you're an end user of a modpack, **DO NOT EDIT THE CONFIG**! This will likely break all modpacks which use this mod.

### Current features

- Different compressed blocks
- Snad (with config)
- More to come!
