## Mainly for modpack creators

With this mod you can set the world type which is selected by default when creating a new world.

Example: you have [Skyblock Builder]({mod_hoster}skyblock-builder) installed and set the value in the client config to `skyblockbuilder:skyblock`. When creating a new world, the user don't need to change the world type for itself to that type.

With this, accidently generating the wrong world will not happen. Or it's just less possible.

The mod is **client only**. For servers, you should just provide the right `servers.properties`, or use [Default Server Properties]({mod_hoster}default-server-properties)

The mod generates a file with allowed config values once you enter the Create New World screen.
